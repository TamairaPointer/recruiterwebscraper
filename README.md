# Job Postings Web Scraper

This Python script scrapes job postings from a webpage and saves them into a CSV file.

## What does it do?

The script downloads a webpage, parses it, and extracts information about job postings, including the job title, company, and location. The extracted data is stored in a pandas DataFrame, which is then saved into a CSV file named `job_postings.csv`.

## How does it work?

The script uses the `requests` library to download the webpage and the `BeautifulSoup` library to parse the HTML and extract the data. It adds delays between requests to avoid overloading the server. Finally, it uses the `pandas` library to organize the data into a table and save it to a file.

## How to use it?

To use this script, you need Python installed on your machine along with the necessary libraries (`requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, `time`, and `pandas`). You can install these libraries using pip:

```
pip install requests bs4 pandas
```

Once you have Python and the necessary libraries set up, download the `job_scraper.py` file from this repository and run it using Python:

```
python job_scraper.py
```

Please replace the URL and HTML tags according to your needs before running the script.
